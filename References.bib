abstract = {A budget model is developed to predict the long-term response of a lake to changes in its phosphorus loading. This model computes total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, taking sediment-water interactions into account. The lake is treated as two segments: the water and a surface sediment layer. A total phosphorus budget for the water accounts for inputs due to external loading and recycle from the sediments. It reflects losses due to flushing and settling. The sediment layer gains total phosphorus by settling and loses total phosphorus by recycle and burial. The recycle from the sediments to the water is dependent on the levels of sediment total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen. Hypolimnetic oxygen concentration is estimated with a semi-empirical model. The model is applied to Shagawa Lake. An analysis is performed to demonstrate how its predictions replicate in-lake changes not possible with simpler phosphorus budget models.}

abstract = {Abstract The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is one of the most common causes of water quality impairment of inland and marine waters. Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.}

abstract = {Abstract The pioneer works of Einsele, Mortimer, and Ohle on the linking between phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) cycles seven decades ago created the theoretical basis for a long-standing paradigm among limnologists i.e., ‘oxygen controls the P release from sediments’. While many empirical studies as well as strong correlations between oxygen depletion and P release seem to support this paradigm, various field observations, laboratory experiments, and repeated failures of hypolimnetic oxygenation measures cast doubt on its universal validity. The temporal existence of a thin oxidized sediment surface-layer could affect only fluctuations of the temporary P pool at the sediment surface but not the long-term P retention. On longer time scales P release is the imbalance between P sedimentation and P binding capacity of anoxic sediment layers. The P retention of lake sediments strongly depends on sediment characteristics and land use of the catchment. The presence of redox-insensitive P-binding systems such as Al(OH)3 and unreducible Fe(III) minerals can enhance the P retention and completely prevent P release even in case of anoxic conditions. Alternative release mechanisms such as a dissolution of calcium-bound P and decomposition of organic P under both, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, are often more important than the redox driven Fe-coupled P cycle. Additionally, bacteria affect P cycling not only by altering the redox conditions but also by releasing P during mineralization of organic matter and by accumulation and release of bacterial P. Since microbial processes consume oxygen and liberate P it is difficult to distinguish whether oxygen depletion is the result or the cause of P release. Nowadays, the old paradigm is discarded and a paradigm shift takes place. Sedimentary P exchange ought to be considered as a complex process which is mainly determined by the amount and species of settled P as well as their subsequent diagenetic transformation in the sediment. The classical paradigm is only valid in special cases since reality is much more complex than suggested by that paradigm. Everything should be made simple as possible, but not simpler!

	abstract = {In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},
